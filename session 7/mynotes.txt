Programing II
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***Client-Server-Modell***
Client sends request to Server
Server sends a response to that client and thousands more
If there is no client and therefor no request, it is not aproblem, it will still be active waiting
The problem is when a client sends a request and there is no server to attend it
First we need to activate the server and check it, then the client
Both programs are working in a computers, torre, general, mobile phone...
In those computers there may be also other servers and other apps working
Usually we dont have two computers, so both can be ran in the same machine and the model will still work out
There is no wire to connect both programs, we use a network that we call internet that interconnects both
Inside the internet there are many computers that are divided in groups called networks. For instance all the computers in the lab are one local network
Therefoe when we need to connect the server we use the 'lines'
One computer can have many network interfaces called IP addresses
An IP address is not like an identification, an IP address changes depending on to which computer we connect

My phone IP address at URJC university is: 10.3.52.186

++Exercise 1++
Check the IP adress at home

In the terminal write: ifconfig to know the Ip address in the second paragraph

The IP address of this computer is: 212.128.253.92
The teacher's computer's IP address is: 212.128.253.64


Ping: command that asks if the computer works ---> ping
Ping time 8.8.8.8 = 3.64ms
Ping time of my own computer (212.128.253.92): 0.02ms
Ping time of Alberto's computer (212.128.253.91): 0.578ms
Ping to my phone: 2.74ms

We cant try to connect through IP addresses because it is impossible to memorize so many IPs
Therefore, we use URL addresses --> identifier of network interface for humans

Lets ping Google (216.58.211.228): time=3.47ms ------>> the url gives you in the terminal the IP address because the internet works with IP addresses
and not with URL addresses.

Therefore for hte client-server-method we need the IP address
We use the Port, usually web severs are in the port 80. In the same IP address there may be other servers, therefore we need to know its port, f. ex. 8080
To connect a server, as a client, we need to know both numbers, the IP adress and the port of its sever
If we dont write the port, the connection will be refused
